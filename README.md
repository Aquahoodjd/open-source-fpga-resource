## Software Projects

### The OpenFPGA project

An award-winning open-source FPGA IP generator which supports highly-customizable homogeneous FPGA architectures
Github repository: https://github.com/lnis-uofu/OpenFPGA


### The Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) project

The Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) project is a world-wide collaborative effort to provide a open-source framework for conducting FPGA architecture and CAD research and development. The VTR design flow takes as input a Verilog description of a digital circuit, and a description of the target FPGA architecture.
