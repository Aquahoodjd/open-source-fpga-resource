## Hardware Infrastructure

### The OpenFPGA project
An award-winning open-source FPGA IP generator which supports highly-customizable homogeneous FPGA architectures
Github repository: https://github.com/lnis-uofu/OpenFPGA

## Tooling

### The Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) project
The Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) project is a world-wide collaborative effort to provide a open-source framework for conducting FPGA architecture and CAD research and development. The VTR design flow takes as input a Verilog description of a digital circuit, and a description of the target FPGA architecture.

### LSorcale
The Logic Synthesis oracle is a framework developed on the top of EPFL logic synthesis libraries to unlock efficient logic manipulation by using different logic optimizers.

Github repository: https://github.com/lnis-uofu/LSOracle

### The EPFL Logic Synthesis Libraries
The EPFL logic synthesis libraries are a collection of modular open source C++ libraries for the development of logic synthesis applications. All libraries are well documented and well tested. Being header-only, the libraries can be readily used as core components in complex logic synthesis frameworks.
